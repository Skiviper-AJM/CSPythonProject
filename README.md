# Godot Action-RPG CS203.2 project

This is a project built for the purposes of academics - specifically a graded assignment to prove progress with the python programming language. 

This project is a Tile-Based action rpg inspired by the likes of enter the gungeon and classic zelda.

## Game Features

- **Tile based movement:** The game is set with a top-down perspective, (ie "birds eye view" or "2.5D") from which the player can see and freely move the character across the world-space.
- **Linear weapon and tool upgrades:** A variety of weapons are available, adding depth and complexity to the movement and combat systems.
- **Hand made dungeons and level layouts:** Each level is made from a specific tile sheet (externally aquired under a commercial license) that communicates to the player where they are and what they are doing, with some re-use (ie certain dungeons may have a different colour scheme but use the same tile sets otherwise)

## Resources

This project runs on godot engine 3.5.2 and is programmed in GDScript, its built-in language.

- [Godot Engine 3.5.2](https://godotengine.org) or later.

## Potential Future Work

While the game is currently under development for a class assignment, it is being built with a future release in mind as part of a portfolio. Additional features and enhancements may be incorporated at a later date to add more depth and variety to the gameplay.
